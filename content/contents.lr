title: FreedomBox, Private Cloud Server
---
body:

FreedomBox is a 100% free software self-hosting web server to deploy
social applications on small machines. It provides online
communication tools respecting your privacy and data ownership.

You can use FreedomBox at home to replace services provided by
third-parties mining your life and using your content. Thanks to a
very friendly interface, you will be able to deploy on demand
applications focusing on confidentiality such as file sharing, shared
calendaring, instant messaging, secure voice conference calling, blog
and wiki.

FreedomBox is a free software stack, a subset of the Debian universal
operating system, that can be installed in many flavors of inexpensive
and power-efficient Open Source hardware, called single board
computers (SBC). Once installed on the hardware of your choice, the
simplicity of setting up and operating a FreedomBox is similar to that
of a smart phone.
